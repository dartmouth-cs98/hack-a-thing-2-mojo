# Hack-a-Thing September 2018

# Who
Moyosore Okeremi and Jolene Bernagene

# Overview
For this Hack-a-Thing, Moyo and I wanted to explore more about creating mobile apps. We have tried IOS app development a little bit but we wanted to look at another platform, React Native. We heard about React Native from CS52:  Full Stack Web Development and decided to go back and try the extrra credit short assignment related to React Native to not only get a feel for how to develop an mobile app using this platform but to exercise our React skills. After finishing the tutorial, we wanted to continue to become familar with React native so we found and followed another tutorial about fetching real time data to make a Weather app. The weather app tutorial, displays a single screen informing the user of the weather at their current location. We built upon this app by incorporating a feature that would allow the user to click on any location from looking at a map, and then showing the weather at this location.

# Learned
- how to connect mobile apps with multiple APIs, Youtube and Open Weather Map, to fetch necessary information for our apps
- how to use react-native maps and add draggable markers, making it more interactive
- how to use google maps geocoder to convert location coordinates into addresses

# Difficulties
- Setting up react native using the Iphone simulator
- weird problems updating node.js
- eslint problems
- figuring out how to navigate between screens in the weather app
- Getting the map to show up on the screen was difficult because there were some particular style properties (position:absolute) that had to be set and we figured this out from a lot of stack overflowing.
- getting text to show up on the map
